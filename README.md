# School project: Game Development

## Description
This is a school project. We are a group of 3. The goal is to develop a fully playable 2D Top-Down Action Adventure with a small story. The game should be cross-platform, so it is written in Java using libGDX. 

_Warning: All code comments are for convenience in German._

## Contribution
While we are developing this game for school, we can't accept any contribution. That would interfere with our task to develop a game ourself. After the 19th of May 2017, anybody can contribute. At this point the game _should_ be finished and the project is no more a school project.
