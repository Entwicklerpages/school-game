# School project: Game Development

## Description
This is a school project. We are a group of three. The goal is to develop a fully playable 2D Top-Down Action Adventure with a small story. The game should be cross-platform, so it is written in Java using libGDX. 

This GitHub README is not the [project homepage](https://entwicklerpages.github.io/school-game/). It is written for developers, not for players.

_Warning: All code comments are for convenience in German._

## Features
These features are from a developers viewpoint.
* Custom player character (name and gender)
* Joystick support (PS4 and Xbox360)
* Simple slot based save system
* Dynamic level loading with Reflection (No hardcoded level index)
* Box2D physics
* Tiled Maps with multiple layers
* Custom tile map renderer with Z ordering
* Flexible menu system
* Cheat sequence detector and a cheat manager for developer cheats

## Tool
The project includes an tool target. This tool is only for game developers. It gives access to the log files and the save file. It also haves an dialog editor to create dialogs much easier. This editor is NOT production ready. It is not well written and there is a high possibility for bugs. _It is just a small helper for us._

## Contribution
While we are developing this game for school, we can't accept any contribution. That would interfere with our task to develop a game ourself. After the 19th of May 2017, anybody can contribute. At this point the game _should_ be finished and the project is no more a school project.
