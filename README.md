# School project: Game Development

## Description
This is a school project. We are a group of 3. The goal is to develop a fully playable 2D Top-Down Action Adventure with a small story. The game should be cross-platform, so it is written in Java using libGDX. 

_Warning: All code comments are for convince in German._
