# School project: Game Development

## Description
This is a school project. We are a group of three. The goal is to develop a fully playable 2D Top-Down Action Adventure with a small story. The game should be cross-platform, so it is written in Java using libGDX. 

_Warning: All code comments are for convenience in German._

## Tool
The project includes an tool target. This tool is only for game developers. It gives access to the log files and the save file. It also haves an dialog editor to create dialogs much easier. This editor is NOT production ready. It is not well written and there is a high possibility for bugs. _It is just a small helper for us._

## Contribution
While we are developing this game for school, we can't accept any contribution. That would interfere with our task to develop a game ourself. After the 19th of May 2017, anybody can contribute. At this point the game _should_ be finished and the project is no more a school project.
